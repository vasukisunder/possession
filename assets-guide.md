## Upgrading to Real Photography

**Recommended specs**:
- Size: 800×800px minimum (1200×1200px ideal)
- Format: WebP (with JPEG fallback)
- Style: High-contrast product photography on dark backgrounds
- Lighting: Dramatic side-lighting with gold accents
- Composition: Vinyl partially out of sleeve at 45° angle

**Recommended specs**:
- Size: 1200×1200px minimum
- Format: WebP or JPEG

## Photography Style Guidelines

To maintain the Possession Records aesthetic, all photography should feature:

### Lighting
- Low-key, dramatic lighting
- Gold/amber accent lights
- Deep shadows with selective highlights
- Film noir influences

### Color Palette
- Dark backgrounds (#0a0a0a to #1a1a1a)
- Gold accents (#c9a96e)
- Rich, saturated colors for vinyl (deep reds, blues, greens)
- High contrast

### Composition
- Clean, minimal product styling
- Geometric arrangements
- Negative space for text overlay
- Professional studio quality

### Post-Production
- Add subtle film grain (2-5% opacity)
- Slight vignette on edges
- Color grade toward cooler shadows, warmer highlights
- Maintain deep blacks

## Recommended External Image Services

If commissioning photography, consider these types of shots:

1. **Hero shots**: Full vinyl + sleeve, partially extracted
2. **Detail shots**: Close-ups of vinyl grooves, gold labels
3. **Lifestyle shots**: Records on premium turntables
4. **Collection shots**: Multiple releases styled together
5. **Process shots**: Behind-the-scenes of curation/production

## CSS Image Integration Examples

When you have real images, replace like this:

```css
/* Replace this: */
.release-card:nth-child(1) .release-image {
    background: url('data:image/svg+xml...');
}

/* With this: */
.release-card:nth-child(1) .release-image {
    background: 
        linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(10, 10, 10, 0.3) 0%, rgba(26, 10, 20, 0.4) 100%),
        url('/images/releases/videodrome.webp');
    background-size: cover;
    background-position: center;
}
```

Keep the gradient overlay for consistency with the brand aesthetic.

## Alternative: Using AI-Generated Images

For placeholder content, you could generate images with:
- Midjourney: `/imagine vinyl record soundtrack packaging, luxury product photography, dramatic lighting, dark background, gold accents`
- DALL-E: "Luxury vinyl record product photography, film soundtrack, dark moody lighting, gold foil details"
- Stable Diffusion: "Professional product photo, vinyl record, dramatic studio lighting, dark background, cinematic, 8k, ultra detailed"

## Current Advantages

The current CSS/SVG approach offers:
- ✅ Zero HTTP requests for images
- ✅ Perfect scaling at any resolution
- ✅ Consistent brand colors via CSS variables
- ✅ Easy theme customization
- ✅ Tiny file size (<100KB total)
- ✅ Instant loading
- ✅ Professional, minimalist aesthetic

The site is production-ready as-is for launch, with the option to enhance with photography later.
